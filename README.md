# Distance-Metrics-Comparison-Manhattan-vs.-Euclidean
This repository contains a Python project that compares Manhattan (L1) and Euclidean (L2) distance metrics by finding the nearest pairs between two arrays of points. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of distance calculations and provides practical examples of how these metrics can be used for nearest neighbor search
